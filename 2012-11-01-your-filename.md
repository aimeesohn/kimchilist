3-4 days of doing the same, monotonous 45 second task.

Well, fuck that. After 20 minutes I wanted to end my own existence. So, instead of actually continuing, I opened up the Excel macro editor, and started trying to figure out how to automate some part of the process. After about an hour, I had something that read parts of the file system looking for the appropriate files. Hooray, progress!

I excitedly told my boss that I thought I could automate this painful and tedious process (which had to be done several times a year). I can’t remember her specific words, but she basically told me to stop working on that and just do it the way they had been: she didn’t believe it was going to work and thought it was a waste of time.

Well, double fuck that. A couple more hours of applied effort and I had a macro that looped through all the images in a directory tree and laid them out in Excel. I spent the next four days surfing the web and handing out files.

This is why I encourage everyone to learn some basic programming.

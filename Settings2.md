#Yesterday, the internet went ablaze with yet another round of hoopla surrounding changes to Organic Reach for Pages, this time because of quotes from Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban published on Read Write Web.

Cuban claims to have shifted his companies’ marketing strategies to Twitter and Tumblr as the “primary” sites for the businesses he’s invested in, and rely less on Facebook.
